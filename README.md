# EDA-Project
Performed SQL-based EDA on the cleaned Layoffs 2022 dataset to uncover trends in global layoffs. Analyzed totals by company, industry, country, and year. Used window functions, CTEs, rankings, and rolling totals to identify major contributors, yearly top layoffs, and monthly layoff patterns, revealing key insights and outliers.
